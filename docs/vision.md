## 🌟 Vision

Codexia aims to become the missing GUI for Codex CLI — a lightweight, cross-platform desktop app that makes working with AI coding agents more intuitive, powerful, and fun.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between raw CLI power and a modern, user-friendly experience, so developers can focus on building, not fighting the interface.

Codexia is built with Tauri, React, and Rust to deliver:
- ⚡ Speed & performance of a native app
- 🖥️ Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- 🤖 Deep integration with Codex CLI workflows
